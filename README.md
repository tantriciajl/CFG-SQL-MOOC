# CFG-SQL-MOOC
The challenge was to analyse the Formula 1 Championship dataset from 1950 to 2022.

This was a collaborative project split amongst four people, each of us having varying degrees of experience with using SQL, some more experiences than others. I was tasked with completing the slides in the 'FINAL RACE:GO!' section of the powerpoint. I came up with the objectives, extracted the relevant data, compiled the data into graphs and then presented my findings to the panel of judges.
